        <h2>What is Jollof?</h2>
        <p>
            Jollof, or jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa. The dish is
            typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, chilies, onions,
            spices, and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single pot,
            although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across
            different regions. The dish's origins are traced to the Senegambian
            region.

        <h2>How to <em>MAKE</em> Jollof</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The inevitable foundation for building up the flavor in this
                meal is to start by <strong>sauteeing the Onions.</strong> This
                should take about 3 to 5 minutes. The next thing is to stir in
                the tomato paste. This adds a deep and rich tomato flavor; I
                simply fry this for another 5 minutes or thereabout
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add the ginger and garlic </strong> and cook along with
                the tomato paste for another two minutes; Actually, by the time
                this is ready, you will notice it in the smell. If you keep it
                cooking any longer, you might risk burning them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add the blended peppers. </strong> Usually, there is no
                particular time frame for frying this pepper. I often stop when
                the sauce becomes really thick, and the oil literally floats on
                top of the sauce. At this point, most of the water is gone, and
                the sauce no longer smells raw. Trust me, you will know, but
                just in case you are still in doubt, I would say maybe 15 to 20
                minutes depending on the quantity of water in your blended
                pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, in building my flavor, I
                <strong
                    >add the thyme, curry powder, salt, white pepper (good but
                    optional), and seasoning cubes.</strong
                >
                Adjust the seasoning at this point if there is a need to
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the flavor is on point, then, I
                <strong>stir in the Rice.</strong> Make sure you stir the rice
                properly until you cover each grain of rice with the sauce
            </li>
            <li>
                Now <strong>add the chicken stock.</strong> Give it a brief stir
                and cover it up with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is not
                fitting enough, simply cover the rice with foil paper before
                covering it with the lid. This is because Jollof needs a lot of
                steam in order to turn out well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the rice comes to a boil,
                <strong>reduce the heat to medium-low</strong>
                immediately and continue to
                <strong
                    >cook until the rice is done, about 20 to 30 minutes</strong
                >
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Serve</strong> with Fried Chicken, Spicy Grilled
                Chicken, Grilled Tilapia Fish, or Gizzards and plantains.
