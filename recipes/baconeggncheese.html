        <h2>What is a Bacon Egg 'n Cheese</h2>
        <p>
            the bacon, egg and cheese “is everything you need: salty, crunchy,
            creamy, filling.” Because the iconic New York sandwich (which is
            also known as a “baconeggandcheese” or “B.E.C.” when you're in a
            hurry), is made at thousands of carts and bodegas in all five
            boroughs, many locals wouldn't think to cook one at home. But if
            you're desperate for the resuscitation only a B.E.C. can provide,
            this homestyle adaptation delivers: gooey cheese, crispy bacon and
            eggs smushed between a buttered roll then wrapped tightly in foil.
            The only in-person experience you'll miss is waving goodbye to the
            bodega's owner and cat.

        <h2>How to <em>Make</em> a Bacon Egg 'n Cheese</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Bring a large piece of parchment paper or foil to the stove.
                Heat a medium (10-inch) nonstick skillet over medium. Grease the
                skillet generously with butter. Place one side of the roll in
                the skillet, cut-side down, and toast until golden, 2 to 4
                minutes. Transfer the toasted half to the parchment, cut-side
                up. Repeat with more butter and the other half of the roll. (The
                second side will take less time, as the pan gets hotter.)
            </li>
            <li>
                If you're using beef or turkey bacon, add 1 tablespoon butter to
                the skillet. Add the bacon and cook over medium until browned
                and crisp, 2 to 4 minutes per side. As the bacon cooks, press it
                down with a spatula. (This helps the fat render, producing
                crunchier bacon.) Turn off the heat and transfer the bacon to
                the bottom roll. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of the fat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the eggs into the skillet, season with salt and pepper and
                set over medium-low. Using a spatula, pull the egg toward the
                center and tilt the skillet so the egg runs to the empty part of
                the skillet. Repeat this all around until the surface of the egg
                is no longer runny but still shiny. Add the cheese on the top,
                tearing into smaller pieces for even coverage. Cook,
                undisturbed, until the top of the egg is matte, just a minute.
                Remove from heat, fold the egg in half, and then in half again.
                Transfer to the bottom roll.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add ketchup and hot sauce as desired, then add the top roll and
                press down. Wrap in the parchment, smush again, and let sit for
                a couple minutes for all the elements to steam together. Cut in
                half and eat
            </li>
