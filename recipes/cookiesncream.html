        <h2>What are Cookies N Cream</h2>
        <p>
            It's hard to resist a cookies and cream milkshake. The blended mix
            of milk, ice cream, and chunks of cookies is a delicious frozen
            treat. It's also easy to make at home and this milkshake recipe is
            fully customizable.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>For 1 serving, you need...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>4-6 Chocolate sandwich cookies</li>
            <li>1/4 cup whole milk, more to taste</li>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups of softened ice cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How to <em>MAKE</em> Cookies N Cream</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Crush the cookies to your desired size. For the best control of
                the pieces, break them up by hand or use a mortar and pestle.
            </li>
            <li>In a blender, add the milk and the ice cream.</li>
            <li>
                Blend until smooth. Add more ice cream for a thicker consistency
                and more milk for a thinner milkshake.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the majority of the cookies, reserving some as a topping.
                Pulse a few times, just enough to mix in the cookies but not
                chop them further.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the milkshake into one tall glass or two smaller glasses.
                Add more crushed cookies on top and a whole cookie for garnish,
                if desired.
            </li>
        </ol>
